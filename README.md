# Intro to DevOps #
Hi,

Hope you are well

This repo is a fork of Hands on Labs repository for the [edX DEV212x Intro to DevOps course](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-devops-microsoft-dev212x-0).
This repo contains all the source code and Hands on Lab manuals for the course.

Additionally, I have included all lectures from the diffenrent modules which are in powerpoint format.

Cheers,

Manolo.
